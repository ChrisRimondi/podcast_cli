                <p>This is a test summary for the RSS generator fix.</p>
<p>The second paragraph contains additional information about the fix that was implemented to resolve the issue where new summaries were not appearing in the index.html file.</p>
<p>The third paragraph explains that the problem was in the add_summary method where the new summary data was created but never added to the summaries list before the list was cleared and reloaded.</p>
<p>The fourth paragraph describes the solution which involved properly adding the new summary to the list and sorting by date, rather than clearing and reloading all summaries.</p>
<p>The final paragraph concludes that this fix ensures new summaries appear immediately in both the RSS feed and the index.html page.</p>
